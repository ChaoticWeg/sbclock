Messing around with [Xen HTML](https://incendo.ws/projects/#xenhtml) on iOS 12.1.1~b3.

### About this...

[SpringBoard] is what iOS calls the home screen, where all of the app icons live. [Cydia Substrate], developed by [saurik], provides a method of injecting arbitrary code into SpringBoard. This allows devs to modify SpringBoard in whatever way they'd like.
